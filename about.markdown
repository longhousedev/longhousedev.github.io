![A picture of I, George Long](static/me.jpeg){: width="300" }

I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, Software Developer at Aerogility, and general nerd.

My PhD research focuses on how we can use Artifical Intelligence to improve the game design process, specifically making the game balancing process faster. I am doing my PhD through the [Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI)](https://www.iggi-phd.org/), centre for doctoral training (CDT).

Aerogility is a Digital Twin for the aviation industry. I am a part of the core model team, and we work on improving the capabilities of Aerogility's multi-agent system.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing games (*what a suprise!*), hiking / cycling, exploring castles, and learning more about the world.
