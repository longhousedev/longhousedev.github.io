Here is a list of projects I have been involved in both as part of my PhD and in my spare time.

## Tabletop Games Balancing Competition

I am running the inaugural [Tabletop Games Balancing Competition](https://www.balance-competition.tabletopgames.ai) for [CoG 2025](https://cog2025.inesc-id.pt). Using a langauge-agnostic API, participents will try to come up with an algorithm which is able to balance multiple tabletop games!

## Tabletop Games Framework

The [Tabletop Games Framework (TAG)](https://tabletopgames.ai) is a program built in java by the Game AI Research Group at Queen Mary University of London. It provides a common framework to implement tabletop games, which are then able to be played by AI Agents such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), or Reinforcement Learning.
